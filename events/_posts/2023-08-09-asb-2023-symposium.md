# Introduction to an Open-Source Approach to Bi-Plane Videoradiography and Multi-Modal Kinematic Tracking.

## Symposium Goal

We are developing an extensible, open-source, software program for image-based skeletal and implant motion tracking with NIH support that will compute six degree-of-freedom kinematics from videoradiography, 3DCT, or 4DCT image datasets. The goal of this symposium is to share our progress on the development and testing and, importantly, get critical feedback from a wide range of potential users as progress towards the grant aims progresses. This symposium will provide a bridge between basic science, kinesiology, engineering, and clinical domains; it is an educational resource and encourages discussion and collaboration among ASB attendees.
